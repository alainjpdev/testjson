Folic acid, also known as folate and folacin from dietary sources, helps support normal functioning of the nervous system and plays a critical role in the proper development of the baby\u2019s nervous system.\u2020 Adequate folic acid in healthful diets may reduce a woman's risk of having a child with a neural tube defect.                              Nature Made Folic Acid is rmended as part of a woman's daily regimen for health, stress, mood, and prenatal care. Folic acid, also known as folate and folacin, is essential in cell division, DNA synthesis, and the manufacturing of brain chemicals in the body. Without adequate levels of folic acid, cells do not divide properly. Folic acid is also vital to the development of the nervous system of a fetus--a deficiency of folic acid during pregnancy has been linked to several birth defects, such as the neural tube defect spina bifida. Therefore, it is rmended that women of childbearing age consume 400 mcg of folic acid per day. In addition, folic acid may also play a significant role in heart health by helping keep homocysteine levels down in the blood. Homocysteine is a substance that forms when Vitamin B12 and folic acid levels are low, and research has indicated it may be a possible risk factor for heart health.  * These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration.

A: Great question. The omega-3\u2019s in krill oil are in phospholipid form, whereas the omega-3\u2019s in fish oil are in triglyceride form. Human cells are largely made up of phospholipids, making krill oil easier for the body to absorb than fish oil, as clinical studies show.*  Q: Other brands with lower amounts of active ingredients rmend only 1 softgel. Your product with a higher amount of active ingredient rmends 2 capsules. Why? Shouldn\u2019t it be the other way around? A: Based on clinical studies, the most significant benefits of krill oil were observed with a minimum dose of 1g (1,000 mg). Each daily serving (2 capsules) of Viva Naturals Krill Oil provides 1,250 mg.
